# SQL_queries_rental_record
Hi There🙋‍♀️, thank you for looking at my SQL Repository, the SQL_queries_rental_record file includes all the SQL queries I run with the dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/. For this analysis, first, I downloded Postgresql Database Management System.
I imported the .CSV files into the Postgresql Database, I run the queries using, JOIN QUERIES, LIMIT, MAX, SUM functions, PARTITION BY clauses, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, among others.

Once I have the results I was looking for, I used excel to clean and create visual graphics, I have also created Pivot Tables for easy search.
To create an analysis that everybody can understand and access easily I used PowerBI to generate a visual report.

## Used tools🔨
* Postgresql
